## Message Queue System with Producer-Consumer Design Pattern

This application implements a message queueing system using the Producer-Consumer Design Pattern. It allows for efficient message processing by decoupling message production and consumption.

**Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:**

* **Producers:** Generate messages and add them to a thread-safe message queue.
* **Consumers:** Retrieve messages from the queue and process them concurrently.
* **Message Queue:** Acts as a buffer between producers and consumers, ensuring messages are not lost even with varying processing speeds.
* **Thread Pools:** Manage producer and consumer threads, optimizing resource utilization.
* **Metrics (Optional):** Tracks message processing success and error counts.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Scalability:** Easily add more producers or consumers to handle increased message volumes.
* **Enhanced Asynchronous Processing:** Enables producers to continue generating messages without waiting for consumers to finish processing.
* **Reliable Message Delivery:** The message queue ensures messages are delivered even if consumers are temporarily unavailable.

**Applications:**

* **Microservices Communication:** Enables asynchronous communication between microservices.
* **Task Queuing:** Queues tasks for processing by worker threads.
* **Log Processing:** Buffers log messages for asynchronous processing by log analysis tools.

**Project Structure:**

* **Main Class:** Entry point, coordinates producers, consumers, and thread pools.
* **Producer Class:** Generates messages and adds them to the queue.
* **Consumer Class:** Retrieves messages from the queue and processes them.
* **CustomMessageQueue:** Thread-safe queue for storing messages.
* **Metrics Class (Optional):** Tracks processing success and error counts.
* **ThreadPoolConfig Class (Optional):** Configures thread pool settings.
* **ProducerThreadPoolExecutor Class (Optional):** Custom thread pool executor for producers.
* **ConsumerThreadPoolExecutor Class (Optional):** Custom thread pool executor for consumers.

**Getting Started (Assuming you have Git installed):**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Configure the application (e.g., queue capacity, thread pool settings).
4. Run the `Main` class to start the message queue system.

**Uploading to GitHub:**

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your local project code to the remote repository using `git push origin main`.

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to extend this description by providing specific details about your implementation.
* Consider including a README file within your project to provide further instructions and usage examples.

By using the Producer-Consumer design pattern, this application offers a robust and scalable solution for asynchronous message processing.
